# ETUDE 8 Rational Thinking

Yashna Shetty and Cameron Moore-Carter

For this etude we used a tutorial for most of the Integer class. That tutorial can be found here:

However, due to the tutorial being written in c and also missing certain functions like divide and 
multiply, we gained an understanding of how c++ works and wrote our own code and implementation.
For divide was tricky and we tried to do a long division implementation but it wasnt working, we were
successful with a long multiplication implementation. With that info we were able to implement a
rationals class with numerators and denominators made of Integer objects. For the Integer we used
char arrays and minused the ascii value to get what was essentially an int array but it worked for the
better with char operations and accesses.


How to run:
Run the make file and run the exe

Test Cases:
3.125/2 --> 1 9/16
7/6 --> 1 1/6
637285 * 482950
-355423 - -22236
1/4 * 2/3 = 1/6
1/2 - 2/34 = 15/34
